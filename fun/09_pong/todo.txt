Short term goal is to create a AI training simulation that can also be observed.
Then training should be able to parallelized.
Test case for a sharing processing pool framework.

Who should own time??

-Visual
	Real player option

	Look at AI simulation

-AI
	Plug the AI

	Set evolutionary algorithm


-Game engine
	Inputs
		Move right (on/off)
		Move left (on/off)
	Outputs
		Paddle position 
		Ball position
		Game time/Score

	Coordinate convention

	Increase speed as game goes?
