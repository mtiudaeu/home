-Remove main.cpp layer
 -Don't make main_lib reloadale for now.

-Add dependencies as a tree data in main_lib.private.h
 -(More a a library array which are gonna be launch/run in order)
 - Data library + runtime library?
  - For now no different type. This will be defined by overloading of different callback or not.

- Data library should have accessor with (address/id) to necessary data.
 - The Data library needs a "tree" of it own for data.
 - The library global handle give a handle to access data.
 - Module which want to access data need a proper ID. -> define in a header
  - A specific Header/id will be included by the private implementation of global_data + the module which it is used in. 

 - Data library should have version
 - Data library could be dumpable (which allow dynamic reload of the game state)
